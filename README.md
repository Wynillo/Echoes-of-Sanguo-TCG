# Echoes of Sanguo — Engine

The game engine and runtime for **Echoes of Sanguo** — a browser-based TCG inspired by **Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories**. Built with React 19, TypeScript 6, Vite 8. Loads card content from `.tcg` packs at runtime.

| Repository | Role |
|---|---|
| **This repo (Engine)** | Game runtime, UI, effect system, AI, mod API |
| [`@wynillo/tcg-format`](https://github.com/Wynillo/Echoes-of-Sanguo-TCG) | TCG archive format library (load / validate / pack `.tcg` files) |

## Game Rules

Echoes of Sanguo is a 1v1 duel card game. Each player starts with **8000 Life Points**. The first player to reach 0 loses.

**Core Rules (Forbidden Memories style):**
- No tribute summoning — all monsters are playable immediately
- Unlimited summons per turn
- Newly summoned monsters have summoning sickness (cannot attack the same turn)
- Fusion monsters are the exception: direct special summon from hand, immediately ready to attack
- Hand limit: 8 cards
- Starting hand: 5 cards, draw 1 per turn

## Engine Features

### Effect System

Data-driven effect system with **60+ actions** and **7 triggers**. Effects are defined as strings in `.tcg` card data and executed by the `EFFECT_REGISTRY` at runtime.

**Triggers:**

| Trigger | Fires when... |
|---|---|
| `onSummon` | Monster is summoned to the field |
| `onDestroyByBattle` | Monster is destroyed in battle |
| `onDestroyByOpponent` | Monster is destroyed by the opponent (battle or effect) |
| `onFlip` | Monster is flipped face-up |
| `onDealBattleDamage` | Monster deals battle damage to the opponent |
| `onSentToGrave` | Card is sent to the graveyard |
| `passive` | Continuous effect while on the field |

**Effect Actions (grouped by category):**

| Category | Actions |
|---|---|
| **Damage / Heal** | `dealDamage`, `gainLP`, `reflectBattleDamage` |
| **Draw / Search** | `draw`, `searchDeckToHand`, `peekTopCard`, `drawThenDiscard` |
| **Stat Modification** | `buffField`, `debuffField`, `tempBuffField`, `tempDebuffField`, `tempAtkBonus`, `permAtkBonus`, `tempDefBonus`, `permDefBonus`, `halveAtk`, `doubleAtk`, `swapAtkDef` |
| **Removal / Bounce** | `bounceStrongestOpp`, `bounceAttacker`, `bounceAllOppMonsters`, `bounceOppHandToDeck`, `destroyAttacker`, `destroyAllOpp`, `destroyAll`, `destroyWeakestOpp`, `destroyStrongestOpp`, `destroyByFilter`, `destroySummonedIf`, `destroyAndDamageBoth` |
| **Graveyard** | `reviveFromGrave`, `reviveFromEitherGrave`, `salvageFromGrave`, `recycleFromGraveToDeck`, `shuffleGraveIntoDeck`, `sendTopCardsToGrave`, `sendTopCardsToGraveOpp` |
| **Summon / Hand** | `specialSummonFromHand`, `specialSummonFromDeck`, `discardFromHand`, `discardOppHand`, `discardEntireHand`, `createTokens`, `excavateAndSummon` |
| **Control** | `stealMonster`, `stealMonsterTemp`, `cancelAttack`, `cancelEffect`, `preventAttacks`, `preventBattleDamage`, `skipOppDraw`, `changePositionOpp`, `setFaceDown`, `flipAllOppFaceDown` |
| **Spell / Trap Removal** | `destroyOppSpellTrap`, `destroyAllOppSpellTraps`, `destroyAllSpellTraps`, `destroyOppFieldSpell` |
| **Passive Abilities** | `passive_piercing`, `passive_untargetable`, `passive_directAttack`, `passive_vsAttrBonus`, `passive_phoenixRevival`, `passive_indestructible`, `passive_effectImmune`, `passive_cantBeAttacked`, `passive_negateTraps`, `passive_negateSpells`, `passive_negateMonsterEffects` |
| **Utility** | `tributeSelf`, `payCost`, `shuffleDeck`, `gameReset` |

### Fusion System

Two monsters in hand can be fused directly. Fusion formulas produce powerful fusion monsters (Level 5–9, up to Ultra Rare). Recipes are loaded from the `.tcg` pack.

### Mod API

The engine exposes `window.EchoesOfSanguoMod` for runtime modding:

| API | Description |
|---|---|
| `CARD_DB` | Live card database — register new cards directly |
| `FUSION_RECIPES` | Fusion recipe registry |
| `OPPONENT_CONFIGS` | Opponent configuration registry |
| `STARTER_DECKS` | Starter deck definitions |
| `EFFECT_REGISTRY` | Read-only view of all registered effect actions |
| `registerEffect(name, handler)` | Register custom effect actions |
| `loadModTcg(url)` | Load additional `.tcg` archives at runtime |
| `unloadModCards(modId)` | Remove cards and opponents from a loaded mod |
| `getLoadedMods()` | List all currently loaded mods |
| `emitTrigger(event, context)` | Fire custom trigger events |
| `addTriggerHook(event, handler)` | Subscribe to trigger events |

### TriggerBus

Flexible event emitter for extensible hooks. Modders can subscribe to any named event with `on(event, handler)` and fire events with `emit(event, context)`. Supports arbitrary custom event names beyond the built-in triggers.

### AI System

The AI uses configurable behavior profiles that control decision-making:

| Profile | Strategy |
|---|---|
| `default` | Balanced play |
| `aggressive` | Prioritizes attacking and damage |
| `defensive` | Prioritizes defense and survival |
| `smart` | Evaluates board state more deeply |
| `cheating` | Has access to hidden information |

AI turn sequence: draw → main phase (fusions, summons, spells, traps) → battle phase (target selection) → end phase. Behavior profiles are assigned per opponent in the `.tcg` pack.

### Campaign & Shop Systems

The engine supports a **node-based campaign** system with duels, story nodes, gauntlet encounters, and unlock conditions. Campaign structure is defined in the loaded `.tcg` pack.

The engine supports a **tiered shop** system with configurable packages, pricing, unlock conditions, and card pool filters. Shop configuration is defined in the loaded `.tcg` pack.

### Progression

All progress is stored client-side via `localStorage`. The engine manages the full gameplay loop:

```
First launch → Choose starter deck
  → Campaign mode → Win duels → Earn Jade Coins
  → Shop → Buy card packages → Receive new cards
  → Build collection → Unlock stronger opponents & new shop tiers
```

### Internationalization

Fully translated into **German** and **English** via i18next. Card and UI translations are loaded from the `.tcg` pack and locale files.

### Mobile App

Android support via **Capacitor 8** — the web game runs natively on Android devices.

## Card Format (.tcg)

`base.tcg` is a **ZIP archive** (renamed to `.tcg`) containing JSON files and card artwork. It is loaded on startup.

The core TCG format library has been extracted to the [`@wynillo/tcg-format`](https://github.com/Wynillo/Echoes-of-Sanguo-TCG) package. It handles loading, validation, and packing of `.tcg` archives with zero game-engine dependencies.

**In this repo** (game-specific glue):
- **tcg-bridge.ts** — connects `@wynillo/tcg-format` output to game stores (CARD_DB, FUSION_RECIPES, etc.)
- **tcg-builder.ts** — converts `CardData` → `TcgCard` for packing
- **effect-serializer.ts** — parses and serializes effect strings (the package treats effects as opaque)
- **enums.ts** — bidirectional converters between TCG integer IDs and game enums
- **copy-tcg.ts** — copies `base.tcg` from the `@wynillo/echoes-mod-base` package to the public folder

Copy via `npm run copy:tcg` — retrieves the base card set from the external package.

---

## Persistence

All progress data is stored in `localStorage` (prefixes `tcg_` and `eos_`):

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `tcg_initialized` | Marks first launch complete |
| `tcg_starter_chosen` | Starter selection completed |
| `tcg_starter_race` | Chosen starter race |
| `tcg_collection` | Card collection `[{id, count}, ...]` |
| `tcg_deck` | Current deck (40 cards) |
| `eos_jade_coins` | Current coin balance |
| `tcg_opponents` | Opponent status `{1: {unlocked, wins, losses}, ...}` |
| `tcg_settings` | User settings |
| `tcg_seen_cards` | Cards seen by the player |
| `tcg_save_version` | Migration version |
