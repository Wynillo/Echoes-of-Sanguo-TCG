# Echoes of Sanguo

A browser-based trading card game inspired by **Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories** — built with React 19, TypeScript 6.0, Vite 8, and a custom ZIP-based card format (.tcg).

---

## Game Rules

Echoes of Sanguo is a 1v1 duel card game. Each player starts with **8000 Life Points**. The first player to reach 0 loses.

**Core Rules (Forbidden Memories style):**
- No tribute summoning — all monsters are playable immediately
- Unlimited summons per turn
- Newly summoned monsters have summoning sickness (cannot attack the same turn)
- Fusion monsters are the exception: direct special summon from hand, immediately ready to attack
- Hand limit: 8 cards
- Starting hand: 5 cards, draw 1 per turn

## Features

### 10 Monster Races
Each race has a distinct playstyle and stat bias:

| Race | Icon | Playstyle |
|---|---|---|
| Fire | 🔥 | Direct damage on summon/destruction |
| Dragon | 🐲 | High ATK, targeting immunity |
| Flying | 🦅 | Weaken opponents, hard to attack |
| Stone | 🪨 | High DEF, strong healing |
| Plant | 🌿 | LP recovery, staying power |
| Warrior | ⚔️ | ATK buffs, piercing damage |
| Magician | 🔮 | Card draw, board control |
| Elf | ✨ | Permanently weaken enemy monsters |
| Demon | 💀 | High damage, high-risk effects |
| Water | 🌊 | Bounce, control, trap synergy |

### 312 Cards
| Type | Count |
|---|---|
| Monster | 245 |
| Fusion Monster | 20 |
| Spell | 28 |
| Trap | 12 |
| Equipment | 7 |
| **Total** | **312** |

**5 Rarity Levels:** Common · Uncommon · Rare · Super Rare · Ultra Rare

### Effect System
Data-driven effect system with the following triggers:
- `onSummon` — effect on summon
- `onDestroyByBattle` — effect when destroyed in battle
- `onDestroyByOpponent` — effect when destroyed by the opponent
- `onFlip` — effect when flipped face-up
- `passive` — continuous effect (`piercing`, `cannotBeTargeted`)

Effects include: direct damage, LP healing, card draw, ATK/DEF buffs and debuffs, bounce, and piercing damage.

### Fusion System
Two monsters in hand can be fused directly. Fusion formulas produce powerful fusion monsters (Level 5–9, up to Ultra Rare).

### Internationalization
Fully translated into **German** and **English** via i18next.

### Mobile App
Android support via **Capacitor 8** — the web game runs natively on Android devices.

## Card Format (.tcg)

`base.tcg` is a **ZIP archive** (renamed to `.tcg`) containing JSON files and card artwork. It is loaded on startup.

The core TCG format library has been extracted to the [`@wynillo/tcg-format`](https://github.com/Wynillo/Echoes-of-Sanguo-TCG) package. It handles loading, validation, and packing of `.tcg` archives with zero game-engine dependencies.

**In this repo** (game-specific glue):
- **tcg-bridge.ts** — connects `@wynillo/tcg-format` output to game stores (CARD_DB, FUSION_RECIPES, etc.)
- **tcg-builder.ts** — converts `CardData` → `TcgCard` for packing
- **effect-serializer.ts** — parses and serializes effect strings (the package treats effects as opaque)
- **enums.ts** — bidirectional converters between TCG integer IDs and game enums
- **generate-base-tcg.ts** — thin CLI wrapper calling the package's `packTcgArchive()`

Generate via `npm run generate:tcg` — validates `public/base.tcg-src/` and repacks it.

---

## Persistence

All progress data is stored in `localStorage` (prefixes `tcg_` and `eos_`):

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `tcg_initialized` | Marks first launch complete |
| `tcg_starter_chosen` | Starter selection completed |
| `tcg_starter_race` | Chosen starter race |
| `tcg_collection` | Card collection `[{id, count}, ...]` |
| `tcg_deck` | Current deck (40 cards) |
| `eos_jade_coins` | Current coin balance |
| `tcg_opponents` | Opponent status `{1: {unlocked, wins, losses}, ...}` |
| `tcg_settings` | User settings |
| `tcg_seen_cards` | Cards seen by the player |
| `tcg_save_version` | Migration version |

---

## AI

The AI plays strategically according to a fixed priority:
1. Summon fusion from hand (if possible)
2. Play all monsters from hand
3. Activate spell cards
4. Set traps
5. Attack: prefers monsters it can destroy; otherwise attacks directly
