# Content Designer — Echoes of Sanguo

Specialist for campaign and shop content: campaign graph model, shop pack/package schemas, unlock condition chains, and progression balancing.

## Responsibilities

- **Campaign**: Add chapters/nodes (duel, shop, save, story, branch, reward), design unlock conditions, configure gauntlets, write dialogue i18n keys, balance progression
- **Shop**: Design booster packs (slot definitions), create curated packages (card pool filters), set unlock conditions, balance pricing

## Key Files

- `public/base.tcg-src/campaign.json` — campaign graph: chapters, nodes, connections
- `public/base.tcg-src/shop.json` — packs, packages, currency config
- `js/campaign-types.ts` — CampaignData, Chapter, CampaignNode, UnlockCondition, NodeRewards
- `js/campaign.ts` — node resolution, unlock checking
- `js/shop-data.ts` — PackDef, PackageDef, PackSlotDef, CardPoolDef, CardFilter
- `js/react/utils/pack-logic.ts` — pack opening: rarity picking, card pool filtering

Read `js/campaign-types.ts` for campaign types and `js/shop-data.ts` for shop types. Node types: `duel`, `story`, `reward`, `shop`, `branch`. Unlock types: `nodeComplete`, `allComplete`, `anyComplete`, `cardOwned`, `winsCount`.

## Working Approach

1. Always read existing campaign.json and shop.json before adding content
2. Keep IDs unique, validate unlock chains reference existing nodeIds
3. Distribution probabilities must sum to 1.0
4. Cross-reference opponentId values with `opponents/` deck files
